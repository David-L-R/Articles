# You Will Never Be “Ready”

Looking back on the past decade, I can say **_that all great things that happened to me_**, happened when I **_took risks and did something outside my comfort zone_**:

- I found my wonderful wife when I decided to chase a girl living 4500km away
- I started a new and exciting career when I jumped into my hobby (coding)
- I met new friends when I went to the beach and started playing volleyball with strangers

If we wait to be “ready” to have a relationship or to be “ready” for that promotion, we might get it when it too late, or not at all.

Because if we are truly “ready” for something, it means we are already 2 sizes too big for it.

**_All the things that will help us improve ourselves, challenge ourselves, are things we are - by definition - not ready for._**

- You don’t need to know everything beforehand to be qualified for a promotion
- You don’t have to have a 100% control over your life to be in a relationship
- You don’t need to be perfect in order to have kids

You just have to give your best.

**_So my recommendation, for myself as for others, do things you are not ready for._**

**_Take risks._**
