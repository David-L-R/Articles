# How to read more books

Several tips that can improve the quality and quantity of your reading, and will improve your focus in the digital age. me, looking aside instead of reading the book

## More is better

Often people read one book at a time. We never surf one website at a time and we often watch a few series, **so why only one book?**

Reading one book means, that if we are not in the mood for that specific story or topic, we do not read.

Instead, if we read several books, we can choose something to read based on the mood.

## Bedtime

This is a tip you probably heard over a million times already, but it is powerfully true.

Going to sleep and waking up with a book, instead of a phone not only will make sure you read more, but also improve your quality of sleep and let you relax before sleep.

## Don't finish

One thing that used to prevent me from reading was the urge to finish each book I read.

That meant, that if I had a reading block, I couldn't move on. Instead, if you are stuck for too long or you found the book not interesting or valuable anymore, stop!

It is okay to read only a part of the book. We don't read every article or post on the internet… the same goes for books.

## Take it with you

At least one book should go with you. It can be a different book every time, that is fine.

Take the book to the toilet, that is one of the best places to read (and to avoid social media).

Take the book to work, so on the train, or while waiting in line, you can read some more…

## Pencil

I learned this nifty trick while studying philosophy at the university. The professor urged us to carry a pencil with every book so that when we find something thought-provoking, we can mark it.

Even better, we can write on the side what we think about it. This way we transform something that is typically passive - reading - into an activity we are more likely to learn from.

## The book is not "You"

When we read only one book, we often have the pressure of trying to read just the "best of the best". But if we read several books, we can afford also throw some entrainment into the mix.

Not every book needs to teach us something!

We can also throw a "trash" novel (pulp fiction) into the mix, and enjoy reading something that takes less pressure and effort.

It is okay to enjoy reading!

## Other Forms Of Media

Something that helped me a lot, was consuming books from different media.

I still like paper books the most, but if we also listen to audiobooks, we can consume books in times we cannot read: while driving, doing the dishes, or cycling.

Also, I really like my e-book. Because I can read books before sleep without keeping the light on, and it is easier to carry around.
