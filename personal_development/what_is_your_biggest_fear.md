# 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐬𝐭? 😱

Like many others, I have stage fright. Talking in front of a group of people was almost impossible in the past.

In high school, I rarely raised my hand. In group projects, I would let others present and I never took part in any school ceremony.

When I searched for my first job as an adult, I knew I wanted to teach, and for the first time, the idea that I will have an opportunity to overcome this fear excited me.

I got a job as an SAT instructor, and the first time I stood in front of a classroom I was panicking. My hands wouldn't stop shaking and I couldn’t even smile.

I was teaching, but I felt the tension in the classroom and I knew it was because I felt uncomfortable.

During the first break, I was telling my sister I was panicking, and she just said “𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝”.

Once I did that, everything went differently, the class supported me for my courage and by the end, they all came to congratulate me (for surviving my first class ever). It was a blast.

Now, almost 15 years later, although I am not scared as I used to be, I still feel excited and anxious before starting a class, but the fear is less intense and shorter.

Still, when I stand in front of a crowd - if I feel tense, stressed, or excited, no matter what - I share these feelings, and every time I see how the barrier between us crumbles.

This has been one of the most rewarding things I changed about myself, so I highly recommend, and reminding myself, to:

- Take risks and tackle what you are scared of
- Share with others how you feel
