Video tutorials are a powerful tool but I think they might pose a few problems for many learners, and actually even hinder the progress of beginners.

Watching videos in the hope we will “understand” is not a good strategy. Learning is done best when interacting with the materials as much as possible.

- Code while you watch!
- Try to pause the video and complete the next section on your ownWhile watching something more advance, try to complete an entire feature on your own before watching.

For example, if the video is going to explain how to use JWT for authentication, try to google and solve it on your own. Use the video as a backup, in case you get really stuck.

This problem usually affects beginners who want to learn code on their own. They are being sucked into watching more and more videos in hope that eventually they will be able to “put everything together”.

In reality, it is easy to watch the 100th “Javascript fundamentals” video without making real progress.The main reason, in my opinion, is that it is frightening to leap forward and start creating your first project.

We never feel quite “ready”, so watching yet another tutorial on “how to make a to-do list” makes sense.

### ✅ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

- Start creating projects from day #1!
- Always try to create something similar but not exactly the same as the project in the tutorial.

When watching an HTML tutorial for the first time, create a basic website for yourself!

Watching a to-do list tutorial? make a grocery list and try to add extra features.

Learning is done best when we set out to find solutions to problems and not when somebody else is dictating these solutions to us.In a work environment, we often need to learn new things and apply unique solutions.

There might not be a tutorial engulfing the entire solution needed, so it is important to learn to apply our knowledge.

So I would recommend working on your own projects from day one! Take new technologies and start building something. The sooner, the better.
