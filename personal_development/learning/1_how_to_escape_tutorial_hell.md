# 𝐇𝐨𝐰 T𝐨 E𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐞 "T𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 H𝐞𝐥𝐥”

ave you ever started something new but got stuck in the beginning level, never quite able to move forward? That is "Tutorial Hell".

We are being sucked into watching more and more videos in the hope that we will be able to “put everything together” eventually.

We never feel quite “ready”, so watching yet another tutorial "makes sense".

## ✅ 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨

1. Start creating projects from day #1!

2. Always try to create something similar but not exactly the same as the project in the tutorial.

Learning is done best when we set out to find solutions to problems and not when somebody else is dictating these solutions to us.

With coding especially (but not only), learning how to apply new knowledge is the best skill you can have.

Do you agree? oppose? Please let me know 🤔
