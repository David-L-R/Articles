# 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐞𝐭 🌳

At 11 years old, I was labeled as "gifted". This should have been an indicator of many educational achievements, right?

So... the opposite has actually happened. 𝐈 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐨𝐫𝐬.

I was constantly afraid to make mistakes or to put effort into studying because that would prove I am not as smart as I was "supposed to be".

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐝 𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐲 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬 and achievements because I was avoiding facing hardship.

Only years later, 𝐈 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐝 𝐦𝐞 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤.

It was that my intelligence, like most other traits, is 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞.

Today, I see myself (and the rest of us) as much more malleable and able to change.

This change in perception helped me to 𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬, more often than not, because these mistakes are the 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝.

I am also much more willing to take risks because I know 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐈 𝐚𝐦 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡, 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫.
