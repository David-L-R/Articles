🌹 Life is (Not) Suffering 

The Buddha's first truth is that "Life is Suffering." But the word "Dukkah" (in Pāli) can be better translated into "Hardship," "Discomfort," or "Effort."

This makes so much more sense to me:
- Being in a relationship is hard, but being alone is also challenging.
- Having a demanding job is hard, but having no career is also complicated.
- Having kids is hard, but having none...

You get the idea... 

But it is also quite beautiful: Everything in life that is worth pursuing demands our attention and effort. That, in part, is what gives it meaning and worth.
