# 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 - 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨 🧹

The only valid way to measure the code quality is by measuring the 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 "𝐖𝐓𝐅???" 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐭𝐞 that other people will think while reading it.

The point is that good code is measured by others. Specifically, by 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐲 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭.

Developers 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 existing code than writing new code.

Even when a developer needs to add a small feature, they probably need first to understand the context.

We will save much more time overall if we spend more time refactoring and improving our code.

## It Does Not Mean

- ❌ write perfect code (what does "perfect" even mean?!)
- ❌ writing good code in the first iteration.

## It Does Mean ✅

- Using known patterns
- Good guidelines
- and most importantly, improving on the solution until a good enough result is achieved.
