# 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞?

This is a question that often interviewees feel like they have nothing to say about.

When we search for a job, especially as juniors, we might aim to get any job, not necessarily the one "we want". Thus, during the interview, we might not have a good answer to that question.

And no, "to pay my bills" is not a good answer. 😅

First of all, they want to see that we've done our research. They want to make sure we put the time to read about the company, news regarding them, their product, technology, and so on.

But that's not everything. They want to see we have a real motivation working there. 𝐒𝐨 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐰𝐞 𝐝𝐨 𝐢𝐟 𝐰𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐲 "𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥" 𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧? 😢

Well, we should find our motivation for working there. It does not have to be our "dream job", but if we dig into the company, we should probably find some aspects that can be relevant for us.

- Their cause? The change they are trying to do in the world?
- Their tech stack? any languages you like?
- The amount of independence and trust they give their engineers?
- Their culture?
- The number of clients they have? (if you want to get better at scaling up solutions)
- and so on...

## 📝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧

Almost every company will have something interesting and relevant to offer, we just need to find it.

So the answer to this question is not about lying, it is about really finding something, anything, that excites you.
