# Tell Me About Yourself

This is probably the most important question during the interview. It usually takes place after a short small talk. Your answer will set the tone for the entire interview.

## Do #1 - prepare and adapt

This is your opportunity to lead the interviewer through your career story by mentioning all the things that can show you are compatible with the position you are interviewing for.

The answer to this question should not be uniform for all companies. When interviewing to different positions, you should adapt the answer and put emphasis on different things.

## Do #2 - structure your answer

I like to use the following template:

1. what now
2. what was before
3. what’s next

### **_NOW:_**

Start with what you are doing now. Mention any worthwhile achievements and fields of responsibility. This is the time to show how you current experience / education is relevant to the position.

> “I finished recently my position as the head product development in an educational company. As part of this position, I was responsible for building several E-learning platforms. I was working with several development teams and overseeing projects both in software development and content development. During this position I realize how much I am passionate about software development, and the life cycle of agile development.”

### **_BEFORE:_**

Tell about your past. Mention only relevant things to the position. Even if you at the start of a new career or in a process of changing your current career, mention how previous experience and education is relevant. It is also good to show how past choices indicate passion and interest in the position.

> “Since I was young, I was interested technical subjects like physics and math but also loved to teach. In the army, I lead a team of data analyst, but after the army I really wanted to go into education. I was lucky enough to find a small startup in which I was both teaching but also part of developing content for E-learning platforms. Later, I was promoted to the head of the department, where I really had the chance to work with software developers. With time, I realized more and more that I really want to take part in the technical challenge. At that time I was already a manager, so I did not want to give that up and become a developer. But the stars aligned and I decided to move to the Netherlands. Starting over gave me the perfect opportunity to ask myself what I want to do next, which lead me to study programming”

### **_NEXT:_**

Talk about the position:

- Why it is connected with everything you did so far
- Why you are going be good at it
- Why it is interesting and what you want to gain from it

I will give as an example, my introduction when I was looking for my first job as a developer after a decade in education.

> “Now, I am looking for my first real technical challenge. I want to work as a software developer and improve my technical skills. I think that my experience as a manager and years working with development teams make me a very unique “junior” because although I might not have a “senior” level of technical skills, I bring maturity and knowledge about the development life cycle. I think this position will match my skill set and will be the perfect opportunity for me to gain the knowledge I seek for (your tech stack… industry…)”.

## Do #3 - practice

In order for the introduction to feel natural, you should write down your story in general points and practice going over them.

What to avoid

- Don’t Bring up anything that is not relevant for the position you are interviewing for
- You can mention personal details shortly (”I am a father of two…”) but I would personally refrain from it
